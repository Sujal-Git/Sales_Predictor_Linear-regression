# Sales Prediction (Linear Regression)

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for plotting, and scikit-learn for building and evaluating the model.

Next, the code reads the CSV file and initializes the features (advertising budget on TV and radio) and target (sales) variables.

The code then splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split function from scikit-learn. The model is trained using the training data and then used to make a prediction on the test data.

Finally, the code predicts the sales for a specific advertising budget on TV and radio (17.2 on TV and 47.9 on radio). The prediction is made using the predict method of the LinearRegression model from scikit-le
